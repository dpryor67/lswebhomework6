# Homework #6

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Functions: pieces of code that allow you to repeat steps multiple times using different values. A function has a name, parameters, steps to be executed, and instructions for what to do with the answer; this is called defining the function. To run, a function must also be called by using the function name and giving it whatever values (arguments) you want it to perform the steps on.

	* Parameters: the variables that are being input to the function. Parameters are like descriptive placeholders that allow you to use a function multiple times with different values.

	* Arguments: the actual values that you give the function when you call it. These values go into the function and replace the parameters, and then the function performs its steps and comes up with an answer.

	* `if` statements: code that checks if a certain condition is true or not, and responds based on that answer. They allow you to tell the code to do Thing A if this condition is true, but to ignore Thing A and do Thing B instead if this condition is false. You can also have the code check multiple conditions and do multiple things by using "if," "else if," and "else".


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. Download (clone) this project folder from GitHub.

4. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.

5. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.

6. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
